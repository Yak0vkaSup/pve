# Security Policy

## 🔒 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The PVE team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

### 📧 How to Report

**Please do NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please send security reports to: **security@pve.finance** (or create a private security advisory on GitHub)

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if known)

### 🎯 What We Consider Security Issues

- Authentication/authorization bypasses
- Remote code execution vulnerabilities
- SQL injection or other injection attacks
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
- Trading logic exploits that could lead to financial loss
- API key exposure or session hijacking
- Denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities

### ⚡ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline**: Varies by severity (1-30 days)

### 🛡️ Security Best Practices for Users

#### 🔐 API Key Security
- **Never share** your exchange API keys
- **Use read-only keys** when possible for testing
- **Regularly rotate** your API keys
- **Monitor** your exchange account for unauthorized activity
- **Set IP restrictions** on your exchange API keys

#### 🌐 Environment Security
- **Keep your `.env` file secure** and never commit it
- **Use strong JWT secrets** (generate with `openssl rand -hex 64`)
- **Run with HTTPS** in production
- **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
- **Use Docker** for isolation and security

#### 💰 Trading Security
- **Start with small amounts** when testing live trading
- **Set strict risk limits** in your strategies
- **Monitor bot performance** regularly
- **Have kill switches** ready for emergency stops
- **Backup your strategies** regularly

### 🔍 Security Features

#### Authentication
- **Telegram-based authentication** for secure login
- **JWT tokens** with expiration for session management
- **Rate limiting** on API endpoints

#### Trading Protection
- **API key encryption** at rest
- **Position size limits** to prevent overexposure
- **Emergency stop** mechanisms
- **Audit logging** for all trading actions

#### Infrastructure
- **Docker containerization** for isolation
- **Environment variable** security for secrets
- **Database connection** security
- **CORS protection** for API endpoints

### 🚨 Known Security Considerations

#### Trading Risks
- **Backtesting limitations**: Historical performance doesn't guarantee future results
- **Slippage and fees**: Live trading conditions may differ from backtests
- **Market volatility**: Crypto markets can be extremely volatile
- **Technical failures**: System outages could impact trading

#### Platform Security
- **Third-party dependencies**: Regular security updates are essential
- **Exchange API reliability**: Platform depends on exchange uptime
- **Network security**: Secure network connection is required
- **Local environment**: User's local security affects overall security

### 📋 Security Checklist for Deployment

#### Development Environment
- [ ] All secrets are in environment variables
- [ ] No hardcoded API keys or passwords
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Security linting is passing

#### Production Deployment
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Database is properly secured
- [ ] API rate limiting is configured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting is set up

- [ ] Secrets management is implemented

#### Exchange Configuration
- [ ] API keys have minimal required permissions
- [ ] IP restrictions are configured (if supported)
- [ ] Withdraw permissions are disabled (trading only)
- [ ] API key expiration is set (if supported)

### 🔒 Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:
- **Acknowledge** your report promptly
- **Keep you informed** of our progress
- **Credit you** in our security advisories (if desired)
- **Not take legal action** against good-faith security research

### 🏆 Security Hall of Fame

We maintain a list of security researchers who have helped improve PVE's security. If you'd like to be included after a successful report, please let us know!

**Remember**: Trading cryptocurrencies involves substantial risk. Please ensure you understand the risks and never trade with money you can't afford to lose.
